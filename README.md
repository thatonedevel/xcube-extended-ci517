xcube-extended-ci517
==========

An extended version of the xcube engine by Almas B. (see https://github.com/AlmasB/xcube2d). This submision for the CI517 module attempts to add a mesh rendering system using OpenGL

# Notes to users
For the demo to function, once built, add the `cubeOfXCube.obj` file found in `res` to `build/res`. In addition, the shader files (with extension `.vs`) in `src/engine/custom` need to be copied to `build/res`
